    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Bathsheba, a dedicated data scientist currently graduating with an MSc in Computational Science from FAU.</p>

    <h2><a href="data_science.html">Data Science in Industry and Research</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Master's Thesis:</strong> I submitted my Master's Thesis on Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection in cybersecurity at Siemens Healthineers as part of my graduate studies under Prof. Dr. Daniel Tenbrinck, Department of Mathematics, FAU.</p>
    <p><strong>Bachelor Thesis:</strong> I presented my final thesis defense on Modeling Intrusion Detection in Cybersecurity for a beverage firm under the supervision of Late Prof. S.K Amponsah, Department of Mathematics, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.</p>

    <h2><a href="wids_conferences.html">Women in Data Science Conferences (WiDS) Erlangen</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Ambassador for Women in Data Science Conference 2023:</strong> I organized and hosted the Women in Data Science Conference at FAU's Department of Mathematics, representing WiDS global at Stanford University. This year's conference took place on [Date], featuring keynote speakers from various institutions.</p>

    <h2><a href="security_ml.html">Security of Machine Learning</a></h2>
    <p><strong>I presented work on adversarial attacks</strong> in machine learning to understand various attack types and perturbations during a seminar colloquium. Detailed results and information can be found in the following projects.</p>

    <h2><a href="team_projects.html">Collaborated Team Projects</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Transformers AI:</strong> Presented a talk on Transformers AI, explaining the mathematics of transformation and optimization techniques used.</p>
    <p><strong>Control and Machine Learning Optimization Techniques of ADAM, SGD, GD:</strong> Conducted comprehensive research on ML optimization techniques.</p>
